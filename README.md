# help.esolia.pro

This doc site is built and based on [lume](https://lume.land/), the static site generator for deno, and is hosted on [deno deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) as static files. It's intended to give details about topics that might be too much for eSolia's main marketing sites, such as details about the security of our PROdb cloud database or bulk email error codes. It takes advantage of the i18n feature of lume to generate content pages in English and Japanese. 

Thank you, [Óscar Otero](https://github.com/oscarotero), for lume and all your support on Discord. 🙏🏻
