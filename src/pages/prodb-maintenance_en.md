# PROdb Maintenance

Our PROdb regular standing maintenance window is:

> **Weekly, every Saturday, from ~15:00 to ~18:00 JST** 

During this regular maintenance window and as a rule, maintenance work that _does not require or cause downtime_ is performed, such as minor software patches or redundant hardware swaps.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> From time to time and despite careful planning, unavoidable situations during standing maintenance dictate sudden emergency downtime that may be an inconvenience to our users. We do appreciate your kind understanding in those cases. 

For any scheduled maintenance that will require downtime, as a rule we will announce this in advance. 

> [!TIP]
> Confirm PROdb system status [from here](https://updown.io/94fd)
