# PROdb's Position
## Using PaaS dbFLEX as a Base Platform
"[PROdb](https://esolia.com/prodb)" is eSolia's software development and hosting service brand name for the PaaS known as "dbFLEX". dbFLEX is operated by [ForeSoft](https://www.foresoft.net/), with whom we contract for platform service provision. eSolia then builds apps upon dbFLEX, for our clients.
