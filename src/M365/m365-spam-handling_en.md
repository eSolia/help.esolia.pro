# Spam Handling in M365

If you use M365, you might find that it can be a little "overzealous" and mark emails as spam even when you don't intend that. Here are a few tricks. 

## Block or Unblock Senders in Outlook

In Outlook you can block or unblock senders [per this help page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/block-a-mail-sender-b29fd867-cac9-40d8-aed1-659e06a706e4). 

## Add to Address List

Add the sender to your address list in Outlook or other email clients you use. 

## M365 Security

In the [security.microsoft.com/antispam](https://security.microsoft.com/antispam) admin screen for M365, you can add a domain as trusted. 

N.b.: Microsoft changes URLs and names but often keeps features the same, so you need to stay on top of that. {.tip}
